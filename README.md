# Personal Portfolio Website

## Project Overview
This repository contains my personal website for **COMP 5130 – Internet & Web Systems I (Fall 2025)**.  
The site highlights my academic and professional work, including projects, publications, and contact information.

The website consists of:
- **Home page** – Introduction and overview  
- **Portfolio/Project page** – Selected projects and research summaries
- **Publications page** – Selected publications with external links  
- **Contact page** – Email, LinkedIn, and other professional links  

## Structure
- **HTML Pages:** index.html, Projects.html, Publication.html
- **CSS:** styles.css (to be added in a css folder for consistent styling)


## Features
- Consistent navigation bar across all pages  
- Accessible design (semantic HTML, alt text for images)  
- Placeholder content and images (to be replaced with real content in later milestones) 

## Deployment
The website is hosted on **GitHub Pages**:

## Next Steps
